Round Trip
==========

This little CLI tool let you validate both MT and MOMT flow using
MSISDN server.

To start a MT Flow:

    python roundTrip.py -H https://msisdn.services.mozilla.com \
        -c 310 -n +1xxxxxxxxxxx

To start a MOMT Flow:

    python roundTrip.py -H https://msisdn.services.mozilla.com -c 310

You can also create a certificate to then try to register on a Service
Provider such as Loop.

To do so add an audience parameter:

    python roundTrip.py -H https://msisdn.services.mozilla.com \
        -c 310 -n +1xxxxxxxxxxx --audience https://loop.services.mozilla.com

The roundTrip.py script will then build you an assertion and write
down a curl command to run to make sure it works.

You should get a 200 OK status code with a Hawk-Session-Token header.

If not, here are the error messages you can get:

  - "Certificate expired": you play too long with this curl command,
                           ask for a new certificate

  - "Invalid audience":    The Service Provider doesn't accept this audience
                           It can be either a misconfiguration on the server or
                           you trying the assertion to a wrong server.

  - "Issuer not trusted":  The MSISDN server that generate your certificate
                           is not trusted on this Service Provider.
                           It can be either a misconfiguration or
                           you trying the assertion to a wrong server.
